# Firearm Retail Website

This is my web development project for **FIT1050 - Web Fundamentals** at **Monash University**.


## 📄 Overview

The website is a mock e-commerce platform called **Clover Firearms**, showcasing firearm products, deals, and an enquiry form. It is a static site built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


## 🎨 Template

I used the existing **ZeroFour** HTML5 template from [html5up.net/zerofour](https://html5up.net/zerofour) as the base layout. I modified:

- The content and text throughout the site
- All image assets (e.g. homepage banners, product visuals)
- The site color scheme and font styles


## ✨ Features Added

- **EmailJS Integration**: I implemented an additional JavaScript feature using [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) that allows users to send enquiry form responses directly to an email address.
## ✉️ EmailJS Enquiry Form Integration

An additional JavaScript feature was implemented using [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) to handle enquiry submissions.

- When a customer fills out the enquiry form on the homepage and clicks "Send", the form data is sent directly to a designated email address without needing a server-side backend.
- This is done via the javascript method and APIs from EmailJS, using a configured service ID and template ID.

**Benefits:**
- Enables real-time enquiry handling
- Requires no custom backend code
- Keeps the project lightweight and static

This feature is useful for demonstrating how a static HTML/CSS site can still include interactive, real-world functionality such as email communication.
